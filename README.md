## Hi, I'm Vic.

**Experienced backend software engineer** — primarily .NET (C#) and Node.js.

In the process of learning **GoLang** - it is quickly becoming my favorite language.

I tend to avoid front-end work whenever possible... unless it's **HTMX** — that's the good stuff.

I can sling React or Angular if the project demands it, but I'd rather be designing **RESTful APIs**, building robust data layers, optimizing performance, or solving hairy domain problems.

My career has been delightfully eclectic: up and down the tech stack, backwards and forwards across the SDLC — from architecture and leadership to hands-on coding in regulated spaces (healthcare, finance, government).

I hold two project management certifications, including the **Project Management Professional (PMP)** from the Project Management Institute (PMI).

Open to interesting opportunities — especially remote backend/architecture roles. **Will work for equity.**
